-------------------------------------------------
This file is for the users of Solaris.
Check out README for general information.
-------------------------------------------------
CAUTION:
Carefully use the mounted ext2/3 filesystem. 
It should be safe if you just read from the mounted system, 
but be careful if you want to write to it. 
Since the FUSE on Solaris hasn't been completed,
you cannot delete and editting an existing file will
cause the bug that you have a duplicate file with the same name
in the same directory.
-------------------------------------------------
How to build:
	You should have FUSE kernel module and lib tool properly installed
